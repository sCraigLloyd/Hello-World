# Hello-World
This is a replacement guide to what is in this repository
I'm new to a lot of things. I'm using this to learn.

I'm interested in flying things, things that move through the air.
airplane wings provide lift
airplane engines provide thrust 
airplane alerons move the air stream


These are some definitions

Motivators
Thrusters – pushes body in a particular direction
Deflectors – moves an air stream in a particular direction

Sensors
Compass – orientation in 3D magnetic field
IMU – orientation in 3D gravitational field
Air speed – velocity through air mass
Altimeter – distance to some datum
Position – location on surface
